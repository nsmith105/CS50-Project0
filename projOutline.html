    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p id="intro">
      Alright, now it’s time to make your website your own. Design a personal
      webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your
      choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are
      entirely up to you, subject to the following requirements:
    </p>
    <div id="links">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it
        should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other
        page by following one or more hyperlinks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at
        least one table, and at least one image.
      </li>
      <li>Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.</li>
      <li>
        Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and
        at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id
        selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media
        query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller
        screens.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least
        one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for
        layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one
        example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
      </li>
      <li>
        In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s
        contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional
        information the staff should know about your project.
      </li>
      Note that not all of the above requirements are covered in Lecture 0, some
      will be introduced in Lecture 1.
